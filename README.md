# Where-to-open-a-coffee-shop-in-Manhattan
Our investors would like to find the best location in Manhattan to open a coffee shop in the borough. Traditionally, entrepreneurs use common sense with simple data points to decide where to open a coffee shop. This time, we will use Python and data analytics techniques to try to find an optimal location to open a coffee shop in Manhattan, New York. Since there are lots of coffee shops in Manhattan, we will try to detect locations that are not already crowded with coffee shops and relatively no appearance of Starbucks in the vicinity. We would also prefer locations as close to the city center as possible.
